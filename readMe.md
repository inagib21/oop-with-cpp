# First Principles of OOP with C++

This project demonstrates the fundamental principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C++. The `Main.cpp` file contains example classes that illustrate these concepts.

## OOP Principles Demonstrated

1. **Encapsulation**
   - Data (e.g., `first`, `last`, `department`) is hidden within classes.
   - Access to data is controlled through public methods (getters and setters).

2. **Inheritance**
   - The `Employee` class inherits from the `Person` class.
   - `Employee` extends `Person` with additional attributes and behaviors.

3. **Polymorphism**
   - The `printInfo()` method is overridden in the `Employee` class.
   - Polymorphic behavior is demonstrated through base class pointers.

4. **Abstraction**
   - The `Person` class provides a general interface for all types of people.
   - Implementation details are hidden from the user of the class.
